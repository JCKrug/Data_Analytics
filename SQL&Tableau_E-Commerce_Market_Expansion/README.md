# Eniac’s Expansion to Brazil – Data-Driven Market Analysis

## 📖 Case Study Overview
In Fall 2018, Eniac, a Spain-based online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, explored an expansion into Brazil. With pressure from investors to scale globally, the company faced a major challenge: lacking local market knowledge, logistics partners, and supply chain infrastructure.

To bridge this gap, Eniac considered partnering with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company offering order management, logistics, and customer service solutions. However, two key concerns arose:

1️⃣ **Product-Market Fit** – Could Magist’s infrastructure support Eniac’s premium, high-tech product line?  
2️⃣ **Delivery Reliability** – Would Magist’s reliance on the Brazilian public postal system ensure fast, high-quality delivery?  

 ⚠️ This was one of the first projects during a 3.5-month intensive Data Analytics Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. We were given access to Magist’s raw and extensive database and tasked with evaluating its strategic fit by analyzing the data, assessing the market landscape, and ultimately delivering a data-driven recommendation on whether Eniac should sign a 3-year deal with Magist.

##  💡 Key Findings & Final Recommendation
📌 Brazil is a promising market, but challenges exist.  
📌 Magist's infrastructure is optimized for SMBs, not premium brands.
📌 Delivery reliability is a concern – 10% of shipments are delayed.
📌 Magist’s pricing model does not align with Eniac’s premium positioning. 

📢 **Final Recommendation: Do not proceed with Magist.**  
🔍 Instead, Eniac should evaluate alternative logistics partners better suited to its premium brand, such as Intelipost or Novatrade Brazil.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
This project demonstrated how SQL and Tableau can complement each other effectively in the data analysis workflow. SQL was particularly useful for understanding the structure of the database, identifying relationships between tables, and generating quick calculations and insights. However, since Magist’s database was relatively simple, with only 9 tables to manage, it proved more efficient to export the cleaned data and continue the analysis in Tableau. Tableau then served as the ideal tool for building interactive dashboards and visualizing key findings.

## ⚠️ Key Challenges
One of the main challenges was dealing with information overload. It took time to explore the data, understand what each table represented, and figure out which ones were truly relevant to the business problem. Once the main business question was clearly defined, it became easier to filter out unnecessary information and focus on extracting actionable insights.
