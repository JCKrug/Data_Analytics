# Eniac’s Expansion to Brazil – Data-Driven Market Analysis

## 📖 Overview
In Fall 2018, Eniac, a Spain-based online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, explored an expansion into Brazil. With pressure from investors to scale globally, the company faced a major challenge: lacking local market knowledge, logistics partners, and supply chain infrastructure.

To bridge this gap, Eniac considered partnering with **Magist**, a Brazilian SaaS company offering order management, logistics, and customer service solutions. However, two key concerns arose:

1️⃣ **Product-Market Fit** – Could Magist’s infrastructure support Eniac’s premium, high-tech product line?  
2️⃣ **Delivery Reliability** – Would Magist’s reliance on the Brazilian public postal system ensure fast, high-quality delivery?  

This project analyzes Magist’s database, evaluates the market landscape, and provides a **data-driven recommendation** on whether Eniac should sign a 3-year deal with Magist.

## 📊 Scope & Objectives
✅ Assess Magist’s suitability for handling premium tech products.  
✅ Evaluate logistics performance, including delivery speed and reliability.  
✅ Identify risks and opportunities in the Brazilian eCommerce market.  
✅ Provide a clear **GO/NO-GO recommendation** for Eniac’s leadership team.

##  💡 Key Findings
📌 **Brazil is a promising market, but challenges exist.**  
📌 **Magist's infrastructure is optimized for SMBs, not premium brands.**  
📌 **Delivery reliability is a concern – 10% of shipments are delayed.**  
📌 **Magist’s pricing model does not align with Eniac’s premium positioning.**  

---

## 📢 Final Recommendation
🚫 **Do not proceed with Magist.**  
🔍 Instead, Eniac should evaluate alternative logistics partners better suited to its premium brand, such as **Intelipost** or **Novatrade Brazil**.
