# ENIAC's Discount Dilemma – Exploratory Data Analysis & Strategy Recommendation

## 📖 Case Study Overview
For Eniac, a tech-focused e-commerce company, I was tasked with resolving a strategic debate:
*Do discounts actually benefit the business?* 

While the Marketing Lead believed discounts fuel customer growth and retention, investors worried they could damage the brand’s premium positioning and cut into profits.

To find clarity, I analyzed Eniac’s internal product and sales data.

## 💡 Key Findings & Final Recommendation
- Discounts have **minimal impact on total revenue**
- **High-priced products** should not be discounted – they generate strong revenue without promotions
- **Low-priced products** are more responsive to discounts – use targeted promos
- **Mid-priced products** benefit from **seasonal, strategic discounts**
- 🎯 **Recommendation**: Adopt a **tiered and event-based discount strategy**, focusing promotions on low- and mid-priced products during off-seasons or high-traffic events
